    <h1>Our Story: The Vision Behind Latimere</h1>
    <p>
      Latimere was founded with a vision deeply rooted in <strong>innovation, progress, and accessibility</strong>. Our name pays tribute to <strong>Lewis Latimer</strong>, an inventor and engineer whose contributions to <strong>electrical engineering and innovation</strong> shaped the modern world. Just as Latimer revolutionized <strong>electric lighting</strong>, Latimere is committed to pioneering <strong>the next wave of AI-driven robotics</strong>.

    <h2>Why Latimere Was Founded</h2>
    <p>
      Technology should <strong>empower</strong> people—not overwhelm them. AI today is often limited to screens and voice assistants, but what if AI could exist <strong>alongside us</strong>, providing <strong>real-time insights and interactive experiences</strong>?
    </p>
    <p>Latimere was founded to answer this question:</p>
    <blockquote>
      <strong>What if AI could be more than just an app—what if it could live alongside us, understand our world, and enhance our lives in real-time?</strong>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      From that vision, <strong>Aethra</strong> was born—a <strong>wearable AI companion</strong> that sits on your shoulder, offering <strong>real-time insights, assistance, and interactions</strong> based on your preferences and environment. <strong>Aethra isn’t just a gadget—it’s an intelligent partner designed to help people navigate life with greater ease, efficiency, and intelligence.</strong>

    <h2>Latimere’s Long-Term Vision</h2>
    <p>
      We aren’t just building <strong>a single product</strong>—we’re laying the foundation for the <strong>future of human-AI interaction</strong>. Our long-term vision is to:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Make AI seamlessly integrated into everyday life</strong>, enhancing productivity, communication, and well-being.</li>
      <li><strong>Ensure smart robotics are accessible to everyone, not just tech elites.</strong></li>
      <li><strong>Evolve human-AI collaboration beyond screens and smart speakers</strong> into a more natural, interactive experience.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Latimere is committed to developing <strong>intelligent, assistive robotics</strong> that make life <strong>easier, more efficient, and more engaging</strong>. As technology advances, we will push the limits of <strong>AI-driven robotics, wearable tech, and interactive assistants</strong>, making them <strong>more personal, more intelligent, and more human-friendly</strong>.
